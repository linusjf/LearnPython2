## Installation

The book has instructions on how to install the requisite software for the examples.

You will additionally need to install the requests package using pip to run unit tests in sesapp_tests.py under project gothonweb.

The tests in sesapp_tests.py have to be run against a sesapp.py instance on the local host.

Feel free to download the code and play around with it.
